This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I picked Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to find answer to below questions:

1. "What are most used programming language in India?"

2. "Do you program as a hobby or contribute to open source projects?"

3. "What are most wanted programming language in India?"

4. "Which occupations were most popular in India in each year?"
