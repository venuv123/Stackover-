## Installation

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need to download Stackoverflow’s 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I picked Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to find answer to below questions:

1. "What are most used programming language in India?"

2. "Do you program as a hobby or contribute to open source projects?"

3. "What are most wanted programming language in India?"

4. "Which occupations were most popular in India in each year?"
